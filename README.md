# ShortcutItPy

This small add-in for Fusion 360 adds icons to some commands and puts them in
a panel so you can add shortcuts for them.

Currently the commands include:
- Isolate
- Unisolate
- Unisolate All
- Find in Browser (but it refuses to be added to the panel, can't tell why)

If you want me to add another, please file an issue on this repository or make
a pull request to add it.

The iconography used is Adwaita from the GNOME project. It is licensed under
either LGPLv3 or CC-BY-SA, and so are my modifications.
